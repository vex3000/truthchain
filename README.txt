🧱 WELCOME TO TRUTHCHAIN
===========================

What is Truthchain?
-------------------
Truthchain is a public space to write what must not be forgotten.

It’s not a social media. It’s not a comment section. It’s not a feed.
It’s a permanent record of truths — written by real humans, under a chosen pseudonym.

There are no likes.
No follows.
No edits.
No deletions.

Just you. Your truth. And the chain.

How it works
------------
1. When you first visit, you’ll choose a permanent pseudonym. 
   Choose carefully — this name will be yours forever on Truthchain.

2. Truthchain generates a hidden secret linked to your device.
   This proves that your truths come from YOU — not someone pretending to be you.

3. Every truth you write is:
   - Timestamped
   - Signed with your secret
   - Linked to all previous truths (like a blockchain)
   - Stored publicly, forever

4. You can scroll and read truths from anyone, anytime.
   Each truth is signed and marked as 🔒 verified or ⚠️ not.

Important rules
---------------
- You can’t change your pseudonym once it’s chosen.
- You can’t edit or delete a truth after submitting.
- You cannot use someone else's pseudonym — it will be rejected.
- Truths are stored publicly and permanently. Think before you write.

Who can see your truth?
-----------------------
Everyone.
Truthchain is public, and the truths are shared openly.

Write with integrity. Write with intention.

Why does this exist?
--------------------
Because we live in a world where truth is constantly erased, edited, manipulated.
Truthchain is different. It’s a ledger for the human spirit.

No algorithm.
No control.
Just a chain that listens — and remembers.

Thank you for adding your voice.
